# TrainTracks
**Project Details** 

**Project Title: Train Tracks**

*Alternative Title : Train tracking system*

About the Project :

- A system to get the location of a selected Train 
- Notification system to inform the passengers about delays and other issues that are relevant to a specific train.
- An Application to check Train Timetables and ticket prices 	

**The Goal:**
	To make traveling by train easier for people by sharing details about train schedules, delays and current locations between the train passengers.

**Objectives:**
	 - To provide the current location of a running train.
	 - To send alerts about train delays to users.
	 - To share railway schedules between users.
	 
**Tentative Problem Definition**
	Annually, there are 133.29 million train passengers per Year. A major concern among those passengers is the lack of punctuality and the delays occurred because of that and the inability to predict the arrival time of the train to a particular station. Those delays can affect day-to-day activities of a passenger. Usually, trains doesn't always run on time according to timetable. So that passengers always have to wait on platforms waiting for a train to come which they don't even sure weather is coming or not. 

**Brief introduction to the project**
	Passengers who are travelling on the train on a daily basis have the problem of not knowing where the train is even though there is a proper time for the train to be in a particular station.Because in the sri lankan context, simply the trains doesnâ€™t come on time usually. So the passengers are in need of a system to provide accurate details about the location of the train. So they can plan the time that they need to be on the station or to know for sure if they have already missed the train. Train Tracks will bring a solution to above problems, to provide current location of a specific train by collecting data from train passengers who are currently on that train.

There have been many attempts to share train locations by adding a tracking system to the train, but due to some reasons, those projects were not succeed because train drivers did not agreed to. Our solution is getting passengers location as train location and provide that data to people who are waiting for the same train.
